# Business Value

### Scalability

The application uses cloud-based technologies ensuring that services remain responsive under varying workloads. EC2 instance in AWS enables the application to handle increased traffic efficiently without manual intervention. It prevents performance degradation during peak usage periods.

### Performance optimisation

In order to optimise the server performance for the US clients the deployment is based in North Virginia. This ensures reduced latency for the target users. 
By using Terraform and Ansible, infrastructure and configurations are automated to ensure optimal deployment settings.
Docker containerisation provides minimal compatibility issues and consistency across environments. Using Docker Compose provides easier container orchestration.

### Cost Savings 

The application uses pay-as-you-go pricing model on AWS platform. It allows paying for the resources in use. Along with the free tier instance, it reduces operational costs while maintaining service quality.
Docker, Terraform and Ansible technologies simplify the deployment process and reduces operational costs.

### Automation
Automation DevOps practices reduce manual intervention, human error, and deployment time. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform automates the provisioning of AWS resources, ensuring consistency across deployments. Ansible automates server configuration and application deployment, streamlining setup and maintenance. Docker and Docker Compose further simplify application deployment by ensuring consistent environments across development and production.
